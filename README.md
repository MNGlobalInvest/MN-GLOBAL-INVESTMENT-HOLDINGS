# MN Global Bitcoin Protocol

Accumulate. Secure. Survive. No exceptions.

### 01. Corporate Origin and Protocol Evolution

MN Global Investment Holdings LLC was established in 2013 in Virginia, Minnesota (Minnesota File Number: 673610200023). Since its founding, the entity has operated as a private investment holding company. Headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, the company underwent a foundational restructuring in mid 2025.

This restructuring transitioned the entity from a traditional discretionary investment firm into a rule bound system governed by the MN Global Bitcoin Protocol. Under the leadership of CEO Terry Williams, the company is now a vehicle for a singular objective: long duration Bitcoin accumulation under sovereign custody.

The entity’s operational existence is defined by its technical specification.

### 02. Governance Logic

The protocol operates on 5 Year Rolling Cycles. All operational logic is locked at the commencement of each cycle. Detailed governance history is maintained in the `governance/` directory.

| Component | Implementation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Philosophy | Discipline over discretion. Minimalism over complexity. | Locked |
| Amendment | Zero mid cycle overrides or exceptions. | Locked |
| Validation | Any deviation is treated as a protocol failure. | Active |

### 03. Core Operational Blueprint

**Treasury Management**
*Detailed logs located in `treasury/`*

Accumulation is driven by deterministic, recurring flows. Discretionary timing or "trading" is strictly prohibited.

* Primary Accumulation: Fixed monthly allocation for automated acquisition.
* Volatility Reserve: Secondary monthly allocation held for market corrections.
* Deployment Trigger: Reserve capital is deployed only during ≥ 5–10% BTC corrections.
* Unit of Account: The entity operates on a Bitcoin Standard. All ledgers, performance metrics, and valuations are denominated in BTC.

**Custody Architecture**
*Security protocols located in `custody/`*

Objective: Zero counterparty exposure and total sovereign control.

* Storage: Multi signature cold storage utilizing hardware based entropy.
* Verification: Air gapped coordination for all transaction signing.
* Redundancy: Geographically distributed key shards and offline secure backups.
* Auditability: Every transaction must be auditable, reproducible, and attributable. Undocumented actions are recognized as invalid.

### 04. Execution Metrics

Success is defined by Protocol Fidelity (adherence), not fiat denominated performance.

* 100% Acquisition Execution Rate.
* Absolute adherence to Volatility Reserve deployment triggers.
* Maintenance of zero loss custody integrity.
* Completion of 5 year cycles without protocol violation.

### 05. Technical Infrastructure
*Source code located in `scripts/`*

The technology stack exists solely to remove human error and discretionary judgment.

* Acquisition: Logic based scripts to enforce frequency and volume.
* Cryptography: Multi signature management and immutable transaction history.
* Integrity: Monthly verification ceremonies and cold storage audit logs.

### 06. Risk and Contingency Matrix

The protocol assumes a hostile operational environment and prepares for catastrophic scenarios.

| Threat | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Key Loss | Redundant seed storage and disaster recovery playbooks. |
| Geographic Disruption | Geographically distributed shard architecture for recovery. |
| Operator Failure | Defined forced response triggers and strict role separation. |
| Regulatory Change | Operating Agreement explicitly defined as a BTC only protocol. |

### 07. Legal and Operational Bound

MN Global Investment Holdings LLC is a rule bound system.

* No speculative promises or fiduciary yield seeking.
* No rehypothecation, lending, or third party custodial reliance.
* The corporate Operating Agreement functions as the legal wrapper for this Protocol.
