## 2. AI-Assisted Governance & Leadership

| Position | AI / Human Role | Function within Protocol |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| CEO | Terry Williams | Final authority on BTC acquisition and strategy |
| Project Director (AI Agent) | Neural Network AI | Autonomous data analysis, accumulation guidance, risk alerts |
| Lead Systems Programmer | Terry Williams | Implements AI recommendations and secure integration |
| Advisory Council (AI) | Neural Network AI | Monthly review of KPIs, risk metrics, and strategic adjustments |

**Governance Principles:**
- CEO approves all major accumulation decisions; AI agents execute under defined constraints.
- Autonomous AI can initiate tasks within pre-approved boundaries: DCA schedules, bulk buy alerts, or yield integration actions.
- Continuous improvement loops ensure AI optimizes strategy based on past performance and current market conditions.

## 3. Capital Allocation & Autonomous Acquisition Logic

**Initial Deployment:**
- **Seed Capital:** Undisclosed
- **Allocation:** 95% BTC accumulation, 5% operational liquidity

**Acquisition Strategies:**
- **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):** Automated execution based on AI schedule with daily/weekly allocation adjustments
- **Opportunistic Bulk Buys:** Triggered by ≥10% dips or AI-identified undervaluations
- **Strategic Partnerships & Early Access:** AI monitors fintech and mining partnerships for preferential BTC acquisition

**Monthly AI-Driven Schedule:**

| Month | Focus | AI Task & Protocol Execution |
|-------|-------|-----------------------------|
| 1–3 | Establish & Accumulate | AI sets DCA schedule, deploys initial trades, confirms multi-sig wallet setup |
| 4–6 | Opportunistic Buys | AI monitors price dips ≥10%, recommends OTC execution |
| 7–9 | Partnerships | AI evaluates potential partnerships, flags early access deals |
| 10–12 | Yield Integration | AI analyzes low-risk yield platforms, deploys optional small % allocation |
| 13–15 | Scale Operations | AI expands OTC & exchange channels, optimizes execution |
| 16–18 | Risk Review | AI performs custody audits, counterparty stress tests |
| 19–21 | Strategic Partnerships | AI identifies miner relationships & adoption investments |
| 22–24 | Optimization & Reporting | AI generates full 24-month BTC accumulation report, adjusts future strategy |

**Key Metrics for Monitoring:**
- Monthly BTC growth % (target ≥1%)
- Cost basis vs. market price
- Optional yield % contribution
- Custody & counterparty risk ratio

## 4. Autonomous Integration & Control Points

**Acquisition:**
- Exchange & OTC execution via AI agent
- Strategic alerts for dips or early access opportunities

**Storage & Security:**
