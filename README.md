# MN Global Bitcoin Protocol
> **Accumulate. Secure. Survive. No exceptions.**

---

## 01. Protocol Specification
The **MN Global Bitcoin Protocol** is the operational source code for **MN Global Investment Holdings LLC**. The company is the repository; the repository is the company. It is an immutable rule set governing long-duration Bitcoin accumulation under sovereign custody.

The system is designed to eliminate emotional decision-making, counterparty exposure, and discretionary risk. Survival across time is the singular KPI. Any deviation from this protocol is a system failure, not a decision.

---

## 02. Governance Logic
The entity operates on **5-Year Rolling Cycles**. Logic is locked at cycle-start.

| Component | Implementation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philosophy** | Discipline over discretion. Minimalism over complexity. | **Locked** |
| **Amendment** | Zero mid-cycle amendments, exceptions, or overrides. | **Locked** |
| **Validation** | Deviation = Protocol Failure. | **Active** |

## 03. Core Operational Blueprint

### Treasury Management
Accumulation is driven by deterministic flows. Discretionary buying is prohibited.
* **Base DCA:** $115 USD / Month.
* **Volatility Reserve:** $15 USD / Month.
* **Deployment Trigger:** Reserve deploys only during $\ge$ 5–10% BTC corrections.
* **Unit of Account:** All metrics and ledgers are denominated in BTC.

### Custody Architecture
Objective: Zero counterparty exposure.
* **Storage:** Multi-signature cold storage (Hardware-based).
* **Verification:** Air-gapped coordination and transaction signing.
* **Redundancy:** Geographically distributed key shards and offline backups.
* **Documentation:** Every transaction must be auditable, reproducible, and attributable. Undocumented actions are invalid actions.

---

## 04. Execution Metrics
Success is defined by **Protocol Fidelity** (adherence), not market performance.
* 100% DCA Execution Rate.
* Absolute adherence to Volatility Reserve triggers.
* Zero-loss custody integrity.
* Completion of 5-year cycles without rule violation.

---

## 05. Technical Infrastructure
The technology stack exists solely to remove human error and discretionary judgment.
* **Automation:** Acquisition scripts used only to enforce schedule, not to predict price.
* **Verification:** Cryptographic multi-sig management and immutable transaction history.
* **Auditing:** Cold storage logs and monthly cycle-based verification ceremonies.

## 06. Risk and Contingency Matrix
The protocol assumes environmental hostility.

| Threat | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Key Loss** | Redundant seed storage and disaster recovery playbooks. |
| **Geographic Disruption** | Distributed shard architecture. |
| **Operator Failure** | Defined forced-sale response and role separation. |
| **Regulatory Pressure** | Operating Agreement explicitly defined as BTC-only. |

---

## 07. Legal and Operational Bound
MN Global Investment Holdings LLC is a rule-bound system.
* No speculative promises or fiduciary yield-seeking.
* No rehypothecation or third-party lending.
* The Operating Agreement functions as the legal wrapper for this Protocol.

---

## 08. Sequencing
1. Lock 5-year cycle parameters.
2. Initialize capital flow automation.
3. Deploy cold storage and recovery infrastructure.
4. Activate BTC-denominated accounting.
5. Finalize disaster recovery playbooks.
6. Assign governance roles and build metrics dashboard.

**The MN Global Bitcoin Protocol is a rule-based accumulation fortress. The system wins by not breaking.**
