### 01 // CORPORATE ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION
[ ORIGIN DATE : 2013 ]
[ LOCATION    : VIRGINIA, MN ]
[ FILE NUMBER : 673610200023 ]

MN Global Investment Holdings LLC was established in 2013. Headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, the company underwent a foundational restructuring in mid 2025. Under the leadership of CEO Terry Williams, the entity transitioned from a traditional investment firm into a rule bound system.

THE ENTITY’S OPERATIONAL EXISTENCE IS DEFINED BY ITS TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION.

### 02 // GOVERNANCE LOGIC
The protocol operates on 5 Year Rolling Cycles. All logic is locked at the commencement of each cycle.

### 03 // CORE OPERATIONAL BLUEPRINT

[ TREASURY MANAGEMENT ]
Accumulation is driven by deterministic, recurring flows. Discretionary buying is strictly prohibited.
* PRIMARY ACCUMULATION : Fixed monthly allocation for automated acquisition.
* VOLATILITY RESERVE   : Secondary monthly allocation held for market corrections.
* DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER   : Capital deployment occurs only during ≥ 5–10% BTC corrections.
* UNIT OF ACCOUNT      : All ledgers and metrics are denominated in BTC.

[ CUSTODY ARCHITECTURE ]
Objective: Zero counterparty exposure and total sovereign control.
* STORAGE      : Multi signature cold storage utilizing hardware based entropy.
* VERIFICATION : Air gapped coordination for all transaction signing.
* REDUNDANCY   : Geographically distributed key shards and offline backups.
* AUDITABILITY : Undocumented actions are recognized as invalid.

### 04 // EXECUTION METRICS
Success is measured by PROTOCOL FIDELITY (adherence), not fiat performance.
* [1] 100% Acquisition Execution Rate.
* [2] Absolute adherence to Volatility Reserve triggers.
* [3] Maintenance of zero loss custody integrity.
* [4] Completion of 5 year cycles without violation.

### 05 // TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
The technology stack exists solely to remove human error.
* ACQUISITION : Logic based scripts to enforce frequency and volume.
* CRYPTOGRAPHY: Multi signature management and immutable history.
* INTEGRITY   : Monthly verification ceremonies and audit logs.

| KEY LOSS            | Redundant seed storage and recovery playbooks.       |
