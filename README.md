## Core Operating Principles

Our organization is built upon six foundational principles that guide all strategic decisions and operational activities:

**1. Single-Minded Purpose**  
Every action and capital allocation decision is evaluated based on its direct impact on Bitcoin holdings. This clarity of purpose ensures organizational coherence and strategic alignment.

**2. 100% Bitcoin Reserve Policy**  
All cash flow and profits are systematically converted to Bitcoin, maintaining a pure Bitcoin balance sheet. This policy reflects our unwavering commitment to our core asset.

**3. Protocol-Driven Operations**  
We employ automated systems and predefined protocols to minimize human discretion, ensuring consistency, reducing operational risk, and enabling scalability across all business functions.

**4. Self-Scaling Infrastructure**  
Our revenue models, technology systems, and operational processes are intentionally designed to compound efficiency over time, creating sustainable growth without proportional increases in overhead.

**5. Security & Resilience**  
We implement industry-leading custody protocols, including multi-signature cold storage solutions and continuous security monitoring, to safeguard assets against emerging threats.

**6. Transparency & Auditability**  
All systems and processes are thoroughly documented to facilitate both internal oversight and external review, maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance.
