**Name:** MN Global Investment Holdings, LLC  
**Jurisdiction:** United States  

**Legal Purpose:**  
MN Global Investment Holdings, LLC exists to design, publish, and maintain **Bitcoin-denominated infrastructure coordination software and protocols**, and to interface with off-chain entities where a legal wrapper is required.

**The LLC:**

- Does **not** promise returns  
- Does **not** act as a fiduciary

## 2. Core Company Definition

MN Global is a **Bitcoin-core-aligned infrastructure coordination company** that enables non-custodial allocation of Bitcoin capital to Bitcoin infrastructure operators—beginning with Lightning Network routing nodes—using transparent rules and automated fee distribution.

The company coordinates **capital, performance data, and incentives**, without custody, discretion, or exposure to non-Bitcoin systems.

---

## 3. Immutable Operating Constraints

These constraints are structural and non-negotiable.

### 3.1 Bitcoin-Core-Aligned Reserve

MN Global operates with a strictly **Bitcoin-core-aligned reserve**.

- Holds **Bitcoin only**  
- No fiat reserves  
- No stablecoins  
- No altcoins  
- No derivatives, hedging instruments, or synthetic yield products  

**Bitcoin serves as:**
- Unit of account  
- Reserve capital  
- Long-term operational base  

This constraint is enforced by design and cannot be relaxed.

---

### 3.2 No Employees

- Zero W-2 employees  
- No payroll  
- No permanent staff  

All work is performed by:
- Independent contractors  
- Open-source contributors  
- Specialized service providers  

**Compensation is:**
- Bitcoin-denominated  
- Performance-based  
- Revocable and time-bounded  

This structure eliminates payroll risk, organizational bloat, and fiat dependency.

---

## 4. Problem Statement

Bitcoin infrastructure requires capital to scale efficiently.  
Capital providers want exposure to **real Bitcoin infrastructure fees** without custody risk.

**Current reality:**
- Capital coordination is manual and trust-based  
- Performance metrics are opaque  
- Fee distribution lacks transparency  
- Infrastructure growth is capital-constrained  

This slows second-layer expansion and concentrates operational risk.

---

## 5. Solution Overview

MN Global provides **Bitcoin-denominated coordination software** that enables:
- Non-custodial Bitcoin capital allocation  
- Performance-based infrastructure operator selection  
- Automated, rules-based fee accounting  
- Transparent, auditable payout logic  

**There is:**
- No pooled custody  
- No leverage  
- No rehypothecation  
- No promised yield  

Returns arise exclusively from real infrastructure activity.

---

## 6. Initial Focus: Lightning Network Capital Coordination

### Why Lightning
- Proven fee-generating Bitcoin infrastructure  
- Clear capital requirements  
- Measurable performance  
- Existing operator demand  

### What MN Global Coordinates
- Bitcoin liquidity allocated to routing nodes  
- Performance tracking (uptime, routing volume, efficiency)  
- Automated fee sharing between capital providers and operators  

This is a narrow, real market with immediate demand.

---

## 7. How the System Operates

### 7.1 Capital Providers
- Retain full control of private keys  
- Commit Bitcoin via time-bound, script-enforced conditions  
- Earn proportional routing fees  
- Exit at predefined intervals  

> No capital is ever transferred to MN Global.

---

### 7.2 Infrastructure Operators
- Register nodes and publish verifiable performance metrics  
- Compete for Bitcoin capital allocation  
- Earn fees tied directly to real routing activity  
- Face penalties for downtime or dishonest reporting  

---

### 7.3 MN Global’s Role
- Publishes Bitcoin-denominated coordination software  
- Maintains performance dashboards  
- Enforces transparent, deterministic rules  
- Collects a small coordination fee  

> MN Global cannot seize, redirect, or rehypothecate funds.

---

## 8. Revenue Model

MN Global earns revenue through:
- A fixed coordination fee on Bitcoin infrastructure fees processed through the system  
- Optional analytics, reporting, or integration services (non-custodial)  
- Support contracts with large operators or institutions  

Revenue is received in Bitcoin and held in the **Bitcoin-core-aligned reserve**.  
No token issuance is required for core operations.

---

## 9. Governance Model

### Phase 1 — Centralized Control with Transparency
- Protocol parameters set by MN Global  
- Public documentation and dashboards  
- Fast iteration and execution  

### Phase 2 — Constrained Governance (Only if Earned)
- Rule-bound parameter adjustments  
- Limited participant input  
- No open-ended DAO governance  

Governance exists to protect system integrity—not to simulate decentralization.

---

## 10. Incentive Alignment
- Capital providers earn real Bitcoin infrastructure fees  
- Operators earn based on measurable performance  
- MN Global earns only when the system is used  

No party benefits from complexity, opacity, or leverage.

---

## 11. Competitive Positioning

MN Global’s advantage is **discipline, not abstraction**:
- Bitcoin-core-aligned design  
- No custody risk  
- Infrastructure-first economics  
- Minimal legal surface area  
- Simple, auditable incentives  

Forking the code does **not** replicate:
- Historical performance data  
- Operator reputation  
- Capital provider trust  
- Operational credibility  

---

## 12. Expansion Policy

Expansion is allowed only after:
- Core system profitability  
- Proven operator demand  
- Stable capital participation  

**Possible expansions:**
- Larger Lightning operators  
- Cross-node liquidity optimization  
- Other Bitcoin-denominated infrastructure services  

> No expansion into non-Bitcoin systems.

---

## 13. What MN Global Is Not
- Not a bank  
- Not a custodian  
- Not a hedge fund  
- Not a DAO theater  
- Not a yield platform  

MN Global is a **Bitcoin-core-aligned infrastructure coordination company**.

---

## 14. Closing Statement

MN Global Investment Holdings, LLC is designed to:
- Strengthen Bitcoin infrastructure  
- Eliminate custodial risk  
- Align capital with real economic activity  
- Operate with minimal trust and maximal transparency  

This company survives on **Bitcoin, execution, and discipline—nothing else.**
